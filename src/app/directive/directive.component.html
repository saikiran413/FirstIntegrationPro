        <p [myHighlight]="color">Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms
            of
            length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality,
            though,
            the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as
            “a
            group
            of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do
            not
            determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly
            journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or
            group
            of
            sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,”
            because
            it
            controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph. </p>
